## Background
Before programming, I worked in philosophy research and teaching. I completed a PhD in Philosophy in 2025 with a thesis on the concept of the grotesque. I taught seminars in Philosophy of Art, 20th Century Continental Philosophy, and an introductory Philosophy module to medical students at King's College London.

That background trained me in **analytical problem-solving**, **structured reasoning**, and **clear communication**, which I now bring into my coding journey.
