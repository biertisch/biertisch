## Background
Before moving into programming, I worked in philosophy research and teaching. In 2025, I completed a PhD in Philosophy with a thesis on the concept of the grotesque. I taught seminars on Philosophy of Art, 20th-Century Continental Philosophy, and an introductory Philosophy course for medical students at King’s College London.

This background strengthened my skills in **analytical problem-solving**, **structured reasoning**, and **clear communication** - abilities I now bring into my coding journey.
